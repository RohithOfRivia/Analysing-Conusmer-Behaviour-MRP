    "Given two items, A and B, lift indicates whether there is a relationship between A and B, or whether the two items are occuring together in the same orders simply by chance (ie: at random). Unlike the confidence metric whose value may vary depending on direction (eg: confidence{A->B} may be different from confidence{B->A}), lift has no direction. This means that the lift{A,B} is always equal to the lift{B,A}:\n",

    "             lift{A,B} = lift{B,A} = support{A,B} / (support{A} * support{B})   \n",

    "\n",
    "One way to understand lift is to think of the denominator as the likelihood that A and B will appear in the same order if there was no relationship between them. In the example above, if apple occurred in 80% of the orders and egg occurred in 60% of the orders, then if there was no relationship between them, we would expect both of them to show up together in the same order 48% of the time (ie: 80% * 60%). The numerator, on the other hand, represents how often apple and egg actually appear together in the same order. In this example, that is 60% of the time. Taking the numerator and dividing it by the denominator, we get to how many more times apple and egg actually appear in the same order, compared to if there was no relationship between them (ie: that they are occurring together simply at random).\n",

    "In summary, lift can take on the following values:\n",

    " * lift = 1 implies no relationship between A and B. \n",
    "   (ie: A and B occur together only by chance)\n",
    "\n",
    " * lift > 1 implies that there is a positive relationship between A and B.\n",
    "   (ie:  A and B occur together more often than random)\n",
    "\n",
    " * lift < 1 implies that there is a negative relationship between A and B.\n",
    "   (ie:  A and B occur together less often than random)"
